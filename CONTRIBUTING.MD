# Commit message standards


I saw this from this repo and thought it was a great explaniation of write commit messages. See here [gist from @robertpainsi](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53)

Write your messages in the impertive form. Example:

GOOD --> "Fix Bug."
BAD  --> "Fixes Bug."
BAD  --> "Fixed Bug."

## A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence

'If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>'
